    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Shawarma is a popular Middle Eastern street food featuring thinly sliced,
      marinated meat (chicken, beef, or lamb) traditionally cooked on a vertical
      rotisserie. The spiced meat is wrapped in warm pita or flatbread with
      fresh vegetables, pickles, and creamy garlic sauce or tahini. Known for
      its bold flavors from spices like cumin, paprika, and turmeric.

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Marinate the chicken: In a large bowl, mix 0.5 cups plain yogurt, 3
        tablespoons lemon juice, 4 pieces garlic cloves (minced), 3 tablespoons
        olive oil, 2 teaspoons cumin powder, 2 teaspoons paprika, 1 teaspoons
        turmeric powder, 1 teaspoons coriander powder, 0.5 teaspoons cinnamon
        powder, 0.5 teaspoons cayenne pepper, 1 teaspoons salt, and 0.5
        teaspoons black pepper. Add 21.4 ounces chicken thighs (boneless, thinly
        sliced) and coat well. Cover and refrigerate for at least 120 minutes ,
        preferably overnight.
      </li>
      <li>
        Make garlic sauce (toum): In a food processor, blend 6 pieces garlic
        (for sauce) until smooth. Slowly drizzle in 0.5 cups mayonnaise or
        neutral oil while blending until thick and creamy. Add 2 tablespoons
        lemon juice (for sauce) and blend. Refrigerate until serving.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook the chicken: Heat a large skillet or grill pan over medium-high
        heat. Add marinated chicken in a single layer and cook for 14 minutes
        per side until charred and cooked through. You can also broil in the
        oven at 450°F for 15-20 minutes, flipping halfway.
      </li>
      <li>
        Rest the meat: Remove chicken from heat and let it rest for 5 minutes .
        Then slice or chop into smaller pieces.
      </li>
      <li>
        Warm the pita: Heat 4 pieces pita bread or flatbread in a dry pan for 1
        minute per side or wrap in foil and warm in the oven.
      </li>
      <li>
        Assemble shawarma: Spread garlic sauce and 0.3 cups tahini sauce
        (optional) (if using) on warm pita. Add 21.4 ounces chicken thighs
        (boneless, thinly sliced), 2 pieces tomatoes (sliced), 1 pieces
        cucumbers (sliced), 2 cups lettuce (shredded), 0.5 pieces red onion
        (thinly sliced), and 0.5 cups pickles. Drizzle with more sauce.
      </li>
      <li>
        Wrap and serve: Fold the pita tightly around the filling. Serve
        immediately with extra sauce on the side. Enjoy hot!
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      For best results, marinate overnight. You can use beef or lamb instead of
      chicken. Traditional shawarma uses a vertical rotisserie, but this
      stovetop/oven method works great at home. Toum (garlic sauce) is essential
      - don't skip it!
