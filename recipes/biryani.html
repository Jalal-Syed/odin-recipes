    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Biryani is a fragrant, layered rice dish from South Asia combining
      aromatic basmati rice with spiced meat (chicken, lamb, or goat) or
      vegetables. It's known for its complex flavors from spices like saffron,
      cardamom, and cloves, and its distinctive cooking method where partially
      cooked rice and meat are layered and slow-cooked together.

    <ol>
      <li>
        Soak rice and saffron: Wash and soak 2 cups basmati rice in water for 30
        minutes. In a small bowl, soak 1 pinch saffron strands in 3 tablespoons
        warm milk.
      </li>
      <li>
        Marinate chicken: Mix 17.9 ounces chicken (cut into pieces) with 0.5
        cups yogurt, half of 2 tablespoons ginger-garlic paste, 0.5 teaspoons
        turmeric powder, 1 teaspoons red chili powder, half of 0.3 cups mint
        leaves and 0.3 cups cilantro leaves, and salt. Marinate for at least 30
        minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Fry onions: Heat 4 tablespoons ghee or oil in a heavy-bottomed pot. Fry
        2 pieces onions (thinly sliced) until golden brown and crispy. Remove
        half for garnish and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook chicken masala: In the same pot with remaining onions, add 2 pieces
        bay leaves, 1 pieces cinnamon stick, 4 pieces cardamom pods, and 4
        pieces cloves. Add remaining 2 tablespoons ginger-garlic paste and sauté
        for 15 minutes. Add 2 pieces tomatoes (chopped) and cook until soft. Add
        marinated chicken and 2 tablespoons biryani masala powder. Cook until
        chicken is 80% done.
      </li>
      <li>
        Parboil rice: In a large pot, bring water to boil with salt and whole
        spices. Add drained rice and cook until 70% done (rice should still have
        a bite). Drain immediately.
      </li>
      <li>
        Layer the biryani: Layer half of the parboiled rice over the chicken.
        Sprinkle with remaining 0.3 cups mint leaves, 0.3 cups cilantro leaves,
        3 pieces green chilies (slit), fried onions, and saffron milk. Add
        remaining rice on top. Drizzle with ghee.
      </li>
      <li>
        Dum cooking (steam): Cover the pot tightly with aluminum foil, then the
        lid. Cook on high heat for 33 minutes , then reduce to lowest heat and
        cook for 25-30 minutes. Turn off heat and let it rest for 5 minutes
        without opening.
      </li>
      <p>Serve: Gently mix the biryani with a fork from bottom to top. Serve hot with raita</p>
